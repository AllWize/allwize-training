2. Existing IoT Technologies (Xose, slides 18-30)
    * Key ideas:
        * There is no silver bullet
        * Every technology will have its pros and cons depending on:
            * Frequency (physical characteristics)
            * Band use conditions
            * Modulation
            * Transmission strategy
        * LPWAN vs capillarity
        * Scalability is still a myth? Not for WMBUS
        * Wize is the only fully open tech
    * Parts:
        * Message transmission strategy
        * LPWAN map and challenges

3. Key Radio Concepts (Xose, slides 31-51)
    * Key ideas:
        * Knowing a bit about radio tech helps understand the whys and hows
    * Parts:
        * Basics (frequency, wavelength, decibels)
        * Antenna characterization (gain, directionality,...)
        * Message on the air (distance, attenuation, artifacts)
        * Link budget & range calculations
        * Advices for nodes & gateways
4. Wize Context (Marc, slides 52-62)
    * Key ideas:
        * Where does Wize com from?
        * Wize Alliance role
        * Not an open band everywhere
